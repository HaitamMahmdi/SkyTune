# SkyTun

### SkyTun is a web app, and this is the **commercial website** for the app.

_All the data—artist names, songs, etc.—are not real. They are placeholders._

## Why I Built This Website

- This is the **commercial website** for the actual app, which is a music player still in the design phase.
- This project is a **training exercise** to help me understand some front-end development tools (Figma, Pinia, UI/UX).
- A way to learn new things and add more projects to my portfolio.
